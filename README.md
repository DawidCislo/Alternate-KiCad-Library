# Alternate-KiCad-Library

Alternate KiCad Library is a symbol and footprint library for KiCad EDA Software. Symbol libraries contain various analog integrated circuits, discrete semiconductors, LEDs and passive components. Footprint libraries contain passives, diode, LED, transistor and IC packages. All symbols and footprints are either edited versions of standard KiCad components or have been created from scratch.

## Version 4.0 is out now, get it via KiCad's PCM or download directly from this repository.

New symbol libraries:
- Crystal_AKL - symbols for crystal resonators and oscillators with pre-assigned footprints
- LED_AKL - colorful symbols for LEDs with pre-assigned footprints (disable 'override individual item colors' in preferences -> colors)
- Voltage_Regulator_AKL - symbols for linear voltage regulators with pre-assigned footprints based on part numbers.

Some symbols have new Alternate Body Styles. Go to symbol properties and check the "Alternate symbol (deMorgan)" checkbox
- 2-pin resistors, diodes and capacitors have a 45-degree rotated version with pins still on the 50 mil grid
- Dual common anode, common cathode and series diodes have an alternative symbol.
- Analog ICs with resistors in their symbols have a US-style resistor version.

Most NC pins were changed to Free unless explicitly indicated as 'Do not connect" by the manufacturer. In some cases having an ability to route through the NC pads or tie them to a heat-sink plane is useful. Now KiCad will allow connecting tracks to these pins, unless they already have an assigned net (i.e. there is already a track running through it)

New symbols for existing symbol libraries:
- Diode_AKL: 1141 new symbols
- Diode_Current_Limiting_AKL: 16 new symbols
- Diode_Schottky_AKL: 396 new symbols
- Diode_TVS_AKL: 137 new symbols
- Diode_Zener_AKL: 476 new symbols
- Diode_Bridge_AKL: 6 new symbols

New footprint libraries:
- LED_SMD_AKL and LED_SMD_Handsoldering_AKL - surface-mount LED footprints used by the LED_AKL symbol library
- LED_THT_AKL and LED_THT_AKL_Double - through-hole LED footprints used by the LED_AKL symbol library

New ThermalVias2 footprints for devices with heatsink pads. These footprint variants use standard untented vias surrounded by soldermask instead of expensive via-in-pad. Thermal transfer efficiency is lower but soldering is more repeatable

## Installation instructions for Plugin and Content Manager:

KiCad 7 automatically adds third-party libraries to library tables, but by default it also adds the 'PCM_' prefix to their names.
This breaks symbol-footprint association and user action is needed for the library to work as intended.

### Either:
Before downloading go to `Preferences` (Ctrl + ,), then to `Plugin and Content Manager` and delete anything found in the `Library nickname prefix` text box. You can then use the PCM to download the library and it will install automatically.
### Or:
After downloading the library from PCM, open `Manage Footprint Libraries` from the Preferences tab. Locate and rename all AKL footprint libraries, so that they no longer have the `PCM_` prefix. Example:
`PCM_Fuse_AKL` rename to `Fuse_AKL`.
For reference, all AKL footprint libraries have `AKL` in their name, see the User Manual PDF for more detailed list of all library filenames.

All symbols should now have correct footprint links.

### KiCad 6 Setup
KiCad uses library tables to keep track of installed libraries. Content Manager does not automatically update these library tables.
To do it manually, go to `Manage Footprint Libraries` in the preferences tab.
 
Press the Folder icon below the table and locate:
`<KiCad 6 user directory>\3rdparty\footprints\alternate-kicad-library`

Multiple folders ending in `.Pretty` should be visible. Each of these is a separate footprint library. Select all the libraries that you want to install and press `Select Folder`

Next, go to `Manage Symbol Libraries` in the preferences tab. 
 
Press the Folder icon below the table and locate:
`<KiCad 6 user directory>\3rdparty\symbols\alternate-kicad-library`

Multiple files ending in `.kicad_sym` should be visible. Each of these is a separate symbol library. Select all the libraries that you want to install and press `Open`.

All the installed libraries should be now accessible.

## Manual installation (all KiCad versions):

Extract the downloaded AKL files into any folder you want.

KiCad uses library tables to keep track of installed libraries.
To install libraries manually, go to `Manage Footprint Libraries` in the preferences tab.

All the installed libraries should be now accessible.

# Known issues

Some symbols or footprints might contain mistakes, this list contains info on all known bugs before they'll get fixed in a new update:

- AD8662: Uses wrong generic symbol (single instead of dual), fix commited by aprgl. Users downloading via PCM will have to wait until the next update.
- ADS626: +VS pin has a wrong electrical type, should be "Power Input"
- AD8209: Wrong datasheet link
- INA132: Symbol graphics shows 25k resistors, should be 40k
- AD8307: OUT and GND pins are misaligned
- MCP6H82T-E-MNY: Symbol has reduntant hidden NC pins on the first unit
- DTV1500MD has a wrong footprint, should be "Package_TO_SOT_THT_AKL:TO-220-2_Vertical_KA"
- Quad CC and CA diode pins are not aligned to grid (1SS308, 1SS309)
- TSMPxxA series of TVS diodes have incorrect footprints, new footprint is needed, since cathode and anode is reversed
- BZX79 series of Zener diodews have a bad datasheet link
- Some Zener diodes are not derived from the generic symbols, but are stand-alone symbols instead
- VOM617A and VOM618A have a wrong footprint, should be "Package_SO_AKL:SO-4_4.4x3.9mm_P2.54mm"
- Some Dual-gate MOSFETs have a wrong mode indicated on the symbol graphics, depletion-mode mosfets should have a solid line instead of dashed for the channel (3N200, BF998, BF998R)
- MJ3000 and MJ3001 transistors have the wrong type, should be NPN
- MJ2500 and MJ2501 transistors have the wrong type, should be PNP
- BC212, BC213, BC214 transistors have the wrong type, should be PNP
- D_SOD-57_P12,70mm_Horizontal_Zener should have a dot '.' instead of a comma ',' in it's filename
- Some TO-252 parts with 4 or 5 pins will not fit the footprint. Both 1.14mm and 1.27mm pad pitch is used by different manufacturers, needs a new footprint. Affected parts: DMC3021LK4, DMG4511SK4
- MCP6044 is derived from a wrong generic symbol, as a result it's only dual instead of a quad opamp symbol. As a workaround use MCP6054 instead and rename it to MCP6044 in your schematic.

If you find any bugs, missing or wrong footprints, missing or invalid datasheet links, wrong symbol graphics or incorrect footprint geometry, please open an issue!

## About:

Alternate KiCAD Library is a massive symbol and footprint library containing refreshed, new symbols and footprints for KiCAD focused on improving Schematic and PCB readability and aesthetics, mainly intended for hobbyist use.

AKL started as a modification of the KiCAD library, where select footprints received new silkscreen markings helpful during hand-assembly.
The list of footprints that have been modified and added has been greatly expanded, along with brand new footprints and footprint libraries.
Double-layer silkscreen variants have been added where symbols have additional information on the bottom silkscreen layer for easier troubleshooting. 

Alternate KiCAD Library now contains massive symbol library 
(over 20 000 symbols as of version 2.0) with Diodes, Transistors, SCRs and Optocouplers. Each symbol is a separate orderable part number (example 1N4001, 1N4002, 1N4003 etc.), each has pre-assigned footprint and a data sheet link.

This third-party library was not created up to the same quality standard as the first-party KiCAD library, wide range of errors might be present. (improper footprint assigned to a symbol, wrong pinout, incorrect footprint dimensions just to name a few)
While using AKL please pay attention and double-check that a symbol:
Has the correct pin arrangement. (Most symbols have pin numbers visible, so it‚Äôs easy to check)
Has the correct footprint assigned in the symbol properties. (Symbol description always states the footprint, but might not always agree with the pre-assigned footprint)
Also check that the footprint has correct pad/hole spacing referencing the part‚Äôs data sheet.

Refer to the user manual for installation instructions and more.

### Compatibility:

Alternate KiCad Library 3.0 works with KiCad 6 and 7 (with minor tweaks, see installation instructions above)

Alternate KiCad Library 2.0 is known to work with KiCad 6.0.0-rc-1 but should be cross-compatible with all KiCad 6 versions.
Footprint library should be backwards compatible with KiCAD 5

Version 1.1
- SMD Diode, Capacitor and Inductor footprint libraries have been split into standard and hand soldering variants.
Capacitor_SMD_Handsoldering_AKL
Capacitor_Tantalum_SMD_Handsoldering_AKL
Diode_SMD_Handsoldering_AKL
Inductor_SMD_Handsoldering_AKL
- Standard libraries are suitable for machine soldering and have no silkscreen under the parts.
- Hand soldering libraries have silkscreen under the part to improve readability of the PCB and reduce component placement errors.
- Footprints (included in those libraries) with bigger pads that used to be called the ‚ÄòHandSoldering‚Äô variants have been renamed to ‚ÄòBigPads‚Äô to reduce confusion.
- Footprint names between standard and hand soldering libraries are consistent. You can easily swap the footprint by using ‚Äòchange footprint‚Äô option and renaming the library in PCBNew.
- Minor improvements to SMD inductor library.
- Some SMD TVS diode footprints had unnecessary polarity marks.
- Crystal and SMD resistor libraries have no silkscreen under the SMD parts.
