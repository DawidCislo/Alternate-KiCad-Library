# Alternate-KiCad-Library

Alternate KiCad Library

Instalation instructions for Plugin and Content Manager:
KiCAD uses library tables to keep track of installed libraries. As of 6.0.0-rc1 Content Manager DOES NOT automatically update these library tables.
To do it manually, go to ‘Manage Footprint Libraries’ in the preferences tab.
 
Press the Folder icon below the table and locate:
<KiCAD 6 user directory>\3rdparty\footprints\alternate-kicad-library

Multiple folders ending in .Pretty should be visible. Each of these is a separate footprint library. Select all the libraries that you want to install and press ‘Select Folder’

Next, go to ‘Manage Symbol Libraries’ in the preferences tab. 
 
Press the Folder icon below the table and locate:
<KiCAD 6 user directory>\3rdparty\symbols\alternate-kicad-library

Multiple files ending in .kicad_sym should be visible. Each of these is a separate symbol library. Select all the libraries that you want to install and press ‘Open’.

All the installed libraries should be now accessible.

# Manual installation:
Extract the downloaded AKL files into any folder you want.

About:

Alternate KiCAD Library is a massive symbol and footprint library containing refreshed, new symbols and footprints for KiCAD focused on improving Schematic and PCB readability and aesthetics, mainly intended for hobbyist use.

AKL started as a modification of the KiCAD library, where select footprints received new silkscreen markings helpful during hand-assembly.
The list of footprints that have been modified and added has been greatly expanded, along with brand new footprints and footprint libraries.
Double-layer silkscreen variants have been added where symbols have additional information on the bottom silkscreen layer for easier troubleshooting. 

Alternate KiCAD Library now contains massive symbol library 
(over 20 000 symbols as of version 2.0) with Diodes, Transistors, SCRs and Optocouplers. Each symbol is a separate orderable part number (example 1N4001, 1N4002, 1N4003 etc.), each has pre-assigned footprint and a datasheet link.

This third-party library was not created up to the same quality standard as the first-party KiCAD library, wide range of errors might be present. (improper footprint assigned to a symbol, wrong pinout, incorrect footprint dimensions just to name a few)
While using AKL please pay attention and double-check that a symbol:
Has the correct pin arrangement. (Most symbols have pin numbers visible, so it’s easy to check)
Has the correct footprint assigned in the symbol properties. (Symbol description always states the footprint, but might not always agree with the pre-assigned footprint)
Also check that the footprint has correct pad/hole spacing referencing the part’s datasheet.

Refer to the user manual for installation instructions and more.

Compatibility:
Alternate KiCad Library 2.0 is known to work with KiCad 6.0.0-rc-1 but should be cross-compatible with all KiCad 6 versions.
Footprint library should be backwards compatible with KiCAD 5


Changelog:

- Footprints now load default KiCad's 3D models when available.

Version 1.1
- SMD Diode, Capacitor and Inductor footprint libraries have been split into standard and hand soldering variants.
Capacitor_SMD_Handsoldering_AKL
Capacitor_Tantalum_SMD_Handsoldering_AKL
Diode_SMD_Handsoldering_AKL
Inductor_SMD_Handsoldering_AKL
- Standard libraries are suitable for machine soldering and have no silkscreen under the parts.
- Hand soldering libraries have silkscreen under the part to improve readability of the PCB and reduce component placement errors.
- Footprints (included in those libraries) with bigger pads that used to be called the ‘HandSoldering’ variants have been renamed to ‘BigPads’ to reduce confusion.
- Footprint names between standard and hand soldering libraries are consistent. You can easily swap the footprint by using ‘change footprint’ option and renaming the library in PCBNew.
- Minor improvements to SMD inductor library.
- Some SMD TVS diode footprints had unnecessary polarity marks.
- Crystal and SMD resistor libraries have no silkscreen under the SMD parts.

Version 1.0
- Modified KiCad Libraries:
Capacitor_SMD_AKL
Capacitor_Tantalum_AKL
Capacitor_THT_AKL
Crystal_AKL
Diode_SMD_AKL
Diode_THT_AKL
Inductor_SMD_AKL
Inductor_THT_AKL

Package_SO_AKL
Package_SON_AKL
Package_TO_SOT_SMD_AKL
Package_TO_SOT_THT_AKL
Resistor_SMD_AKL
Resistor_THT_AKL
These libraries inherit KiCad’s pad layout and footprint names so you can easily swap footprints using ‘change footprint’ option and renaming the library in PCBNew.
Some new footprints have been added, see the showcase folder for details.
- New footprint library:
Jumper_AKL
Adds THT jumpers with multiple pin pitch and two wire diameters variants. Helpful during single-sided PCB layout.
