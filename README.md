What does this mean?
You can freely use Alternate KiCad Library data for commercial, closed and non-commercial projects
without any restrictions. There is no need to attribute this library or original KiCad libraries within your
design and no obligation to share any project files under this or any other license agreement.
If you wish to redistribute the Alternate KiCad Library, or its parts (including in modified form) as a
collection you need to share it under the same license agreement. Libraries must also retain attribution

About:
The aim of this library is to provide a different way of utilizing the silkscreen layer to maximize the
amount of information per component. This library consists mostly of modified footprints from KiCad
library and some brand new footprints that match the new style and philosophy.
• Different types of components can now be distinguished more easily (e.g. axial capacitors and
resistors).
• Directional components have more pronounced polarity (diodes, tantalum capacitors etc.).
• Integrated circuits have marks that make counting pins easier (for example when you need to
test a specific pin on a large IC during troubleshooting).
• Different visual style – SMD parts have a rectangular outline and a dot marking pin 1.
Parts of this library deliberately violate the original KiCad Library Convention by including silkscreen
drawings under some of the components. Additionaly some SMD footprints might take more physical
space that original KiCad ones.
This should make the PCB easier to ‘read’ and reduce errors during hand-soldering and
troubleshooting at a cost of lower layout density.

Compatibility:
Alternate KiCad Library 1.0 is known to work with KiCad 5.1.9 but should be cross-compatible with all
KiCad 5 versions.
Footprint library should be forward-compatible with the upcoming KiCad 6 (tested on nightly build
r22263).

Disclaimer:
Alternate KiCad Library as a modification of KiCad Libraries is a work of a single person and is not
guaranteed to be correct.
If you find any errors please send me an e-mail with the details (footprint name, link to datasheet,
screenshots showing the error) here: dawid_cislo@o2.pl
It might take months between updates, because I’m making this project in my spare time, but more
features are coming.
